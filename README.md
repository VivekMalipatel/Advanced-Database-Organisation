# Programming Assignments for CS525

## Organization

This repository contains the programming assignments for CS525. Students will implement a simple database-like system from scratch, exploring the implementation of concepts and data structures discussed in lectures and readings.

Each assignment builds upon the previous one, culminating in a comprehensive understanding and a functioning system by the end of the course. The assignments must be implemented using C.

### Assignments Overview

- **Assignment 1 - Storage Manager:** Create a storage manager for reading/writing blocks to/from a file on disk.
- **Assignment 2 - Buffer Manager:** Develop a buffer manager to handle blocks in memory, including block replacement strategies.
- **Assignment 3 - Record Manager:** Implement a record manager for navigating, inserting, and deleting records.
- **Assignment 4 - B+-Tree Index:** Implement a disk-based B+-tree index structure.

### Optional Assignments

Students may choose to undertake an optional assignment for extra credit. These assignments are designed to expand upon the skills and systems developed in the core assignments.

## Server Account

All students will be provided with an account on `fourier.cs.iit.edu` for testing their code. The TAs will use this environment to evaluate submissions.

## Docker Image

A docker image is available for creating a consistent testing environment. More details can be found here: [cs525-docker](https://github.com/IITDBGroup/cs525-docker).

## Source Code Management

Students will work in groups of three. Each group will receive a private repository named `cs525-s23-group` on GitHub for collaboration and submission. Code must be submitted by midnight on the due date.

## Grading

Assignments will be graded based on:

- **Functionality:** Completion of all specified tasks.
- **Documentation:** Clear and comprehensive documentation.
- **Code Organization:** Logical structuring of code.
- **Innovation:** Use of novel ideas and techniques.

Plagiarism will not be tolerated and will result in severe consequences.

### Late Policy

- 1-3 days late: 10% deduction
- 4-7 days late: 20% deduction
- More than 7 days late: No credit

## Optional Assignment Ideas

Suggestions for optional assignments include, but are not limited to, implementing standard operator algorithms like:

- Nested loop join
- Merge join
- Sorting aggregate
- Hash aggregate
- Union

## Recommended Tools and Resources

Students should familiarize themselves with the following:

- *nix operating systems and C standard library
- System calls for file management
- Debugging tools like gdb, LLDB, and valgrind
- Docker for virtualized testing environments

The docker image for testing can be found at [cs525-docker](https://github.com/IITDBGroup/cs525-docker).

## Resources

A resources page will be provided with links to relevant documentation and tutorials.
